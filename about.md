I created this blog to use as a reference guide for all of my studies, research, and anything I feel important worthy of sharing. Currently, I'm an intrusion analyst for **WatchGuard Technologies, Inc.** and student at **Saint Louis University (_SLU_)** studying to obtain a Master of Science (M.S.) in Cyber Security degree. My current research interests are phishing, website/DNS analysis, wireless (in)security, and reverse malware engineering/malware analysis. All information on this website or derived from this website are my personal thoughts and in no way reflect the thoughts of **WatchGuard Technologies, Inc.** or _ **SLU** _.

**CV Available by [request](/contact/).**
