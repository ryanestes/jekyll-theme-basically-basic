Beginning the week of August 23rd, a [SMiShing](#smishing) campaign began to unfold that, by and large, impersonated large mail carrier and parcel services with the intention of stealing sensitive information from the victims. This post will explain the high-level tactics and technologies the attacker(s) used to send these SMiShes as well as several real-world text message examples that were attributed to this campaign, including myself. At the end of this post will be the list of known domains and URLs used in this campaign (tentative).

## Preliminary Information

SMiShing campaigns, and other similar [social engineering](#socialengineering) attacks, often utilize current events and other psychological tricks to further coerce victims into divulging sensitive information. For example, I bet you have received an email, text, or instant message that claims you can lose 50 pounds fast and all you have to do to get a limited supply of their supplement is to click a link. Well, there are several psychological factors at play here, but there are two that stick out immediately:

1. The attacker assumes that the victim wants to lose weight or has body image issues. Considering about [half of Americans say that they're trying to lose weight](https://time.com/5334532/weight-loss-americans/), this is an effective approach
2. The use of the words "limited supply" imply that the stock is low and the victim needs to react fast to get this supplement. This is a common tactic in social engineering that combines emotion with time-sensitive decisions.

The SMiShing campaign in this post impersonated common postal and parcel services in the United States such as USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, and Amazon. This is another effective industry to impersonate as the general public doesn't exact have much trust in these services. For starters, a [report from Clutch](https://clutch.co/logistics/resources/package-theft-statistics-people-trust-ups-most-deliver-packages-safely) states that 29% of people trust UPS to deliver their package securely, the highest score of all 5 carriers listed (USPS 27%, Amazon 22%, FedEx 20%, DHL 2%). Not to mention an increasing number of people have distrust towards the USPS considering the political charade occurring there that is [undermining confidence](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/20/trump-usps-attacks-vote-by-mail-confidence) and [continuing despite promises to cease](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/08/19/reports-of-dismantled-usps-sorting-machines-continue-despite-dejoy-announcing-halt/#7a6bd2c026b9). To make it worse, [1 in 5 of people who receive their packages are victims of porch piracy](https://www.valuepenguin.com/nearly-one-in-five-consumers-experienced-package-theft-since-start-of-quarantine). A perfect topic for a SMiShing campaign, indeed.
