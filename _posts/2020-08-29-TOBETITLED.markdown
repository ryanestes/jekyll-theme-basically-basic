## Introduction

I haven't posted in a while so I figured I had enough time to do a simple post on a phishing attempt I came across today. This short post will show how I used open-source information to discover an attacker's *apparent* location from a phishing attempt that impersonated Facebook.

## The Phish

**URL:** s3[.]us-west-1[.]wasabisys[.]com/tranqueavisp/indexs[.]html

When navigating to the site, there are immediate red flags.

1. The URL is not of a Facebook domain.
2. There is a warning banner at the top of the page in red lettering which, is not inherently bad or malicious, but it creates a sense of urgency for the user which is seen in some phishing campaigns.

## Inspection

I've already determined that this is a phish just from the assumptions above, but it doesn't hurt being curious to see
