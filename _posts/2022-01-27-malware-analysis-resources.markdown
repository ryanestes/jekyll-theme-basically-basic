# Malware Analysis Resources

This post encompasses all of the resources I have collected during my tenure as a cybersecurity professional and malware analyst. Although all of these resources may not be directly related to malware analysis, the information will assist in malware analysis efforts, in my opinion.

If any of the hyperlinks are out of date or you believe a resource can be added to the list, I'd be glad to add it if applicable. You can [contact me](https://ryandinho.me/contact.html) and I will attempt to get back to you as soon as possible.

I will eventually move this master list to a more easily navigatable format such as seperate pages for each topic and subpages.

### Virtual Machines and Distros

This section includes all of the virtual machines and Linux distros related to malware analysis, forensics, and penetration testing. These will likely not be
used in Panda Labs as the infrastructure has already been established, but this is a good way to learn different Linux distros, different tools within each
distro, and methodologies for learning external to work. In other words, establishing a malware analysis infrastructure on a personal machine in conjunction
with other learning and tools is a good way to learn more about malware analysis. The resource subsections are provided below:

* Linux Distros and VMs
* Sandboxes and Portable Labs
* Virtual Machine Managers

#### Linux Distros and VMs
